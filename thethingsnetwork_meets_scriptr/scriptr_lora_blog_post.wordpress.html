<h1 id="thethingsnetwork-meets-scriptr">TheThingsNetwork meets scriptr;</h1>
<p>To realize the dream of the Internet of Things, we need an ubiquitous IoT data network. While smart dishwashers and smart garage doors can connect via a home's WiFi network, many IoT devices are out of range of existing wired or WiFi networks. Cellular and satellite networks have excellent coverage, but are costly in terms of airtime fees and power. The Internet of Things demands an outdoor, long-range, and low-power data network solution.</p>
<p>Recent developments in <a href="https://www.lora-alliance.org/">LoRaWAN</a> radio technology allows low-power sensors to connect to distant internet gateways over free-to-use radio spectrum. Several competing commercial LoRaWAN providers now exist, or companies can build their own networks of gateways. However, the proliferation of different LoRaWAN networks in the same geographical area wastes resources and may cause crowding of the radio spectrum. Furthermore, commercial LoRaWAN providers charge for access to their networks just as with cellular and satellite.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://thethingsnetwork.org/">TheThingsNetwork</a> (TTN) is an open-source data network owned and operated by its users built on top of LoRaWAN. Anyone is free to setup a gateway, and anyone may use those gateways at no charge. All source code for the network software is <a href="https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork">developed in the open on GitHub</a> to harness the strengths of developers world-wide. TTN is currently in 50+ cities and is growing rapidly through the efforts of local communities.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will cover how to connect a device via TheThingsNetwork to Scriptr. We cover step-by-step how to connect a LoRa radio to a Raspberry Pi single-board computer. Also, as you may not have a gateway in range yet, we also cover gateway setup. We then show how with just a few lines of code, you can get TheThingsNetwork data into Scriptr.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, we will use the following hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi (a good <a href="https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-starter-ultimate-kit.html">starter kit</a> is available from CanaKit)</li>

</ul>
<p>We will cover how to connect a Raspberry Pi node through the Multi-Tech Conduit gateway to TheThingsNetwork. Then we show how to pull data from TTN into Scriptr.</p>

<h2 id="raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</h2>
<p>We will assume you have a Raspberry Pi or other Linux-based single-board computer to use as your node hardware. For initial setup you will need internet access. You may alternatively use a PC running Linux to act as the node for testing purposes, as it makes no difference as far as TheThingsNetwork and Scriptr are concerned.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="rpi.jpg" alt="photo of raspberry pi" /><p class="caption">photo of raspberry pi</p>
</div>
<h3 id="download-python-script">Download Python Script</h3>
<p>First, connect to your Raspberry Pi and get to a bash command line. Then create a directory for source code as follows:</p>
<pre>cd
mkdir src
cd src</pre>
<p>Now download git if needed, and use git to download the example node script from GitHub:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/chrismerck/ttn_node_py.git
cd ttn_node_py</pre>
<p>Now try running the lora_mote_send.py script with no arguments. You should get usage information:</p>
<pre>python lora_mote_send.py</pre>
<h3 id="attach-microchip-loramote">Attach Microchip LoRaMOTE</h3>
<p>The Microchip LoRaMOTE is a development board for Microchip's RN2903 (or RN2483 in Europe) LoRaWAN tranceiver module. Many other development boards and tranceivers are available, however the RN2903 is one of the easiest to use. In addition to the RN2903 tranceiver, the LoRaMOTE has a built in PIC microcontroller, temperature and light sensors, AAA battery pack, and USB port. In this tutorial we will not use the sensors, but simply pass data through from the Raspberry Pi to a gateway.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="lora_mote.jpg" alt="photo of loramote" /><p class="caption">photo of loramote</p>
</div>
<p>When you plug in the LoRaMOTE to the Raspberry Pi, Raspbian Linux will create a serial port device in its file system for communicating with the Mote. To tell the name of that serial device, you will want to first clear the device message log by running the following command at the Raspberry Pi's bash prompt:</p>
<pre>sudo dmesg -c</pre>
<p>Next, plug in the LoRaMOTE to the Pi using the provided USB mini-B cable. Now again run the dmesg command. You should see a number of messages in the console like this:</p>
<pre>[198997.954943] usb 1-1.1: new full-speed USB device number 13 using xhci_hcd
[198998.062393] usb 1-1.1: New USB device found, idVendor=04d8, idProduct=000a
[198998.062406] usb 1-1.1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
[198998.062407] usb 1-1.1: Product: CDC RS-232 Emulation Demo
[198998.062408] usb 1-1.1: Manufacturer: Microchip Technology Inc.
[198998.063314] cdc_acm 1-1.1:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device</pre>
<p>The important line is the last one, where we learn that the device /dev/ttyACM0 has been created in Linux to allow communicating with the LoRaMOTE.</p>
<p>Now try using lora_mote_send.py to send a test packet:</p>
<pre>python lora_mote_send.py /dev/ttyACM0 DEADBEEF AABBCCDD</pre>
<p>Here you will need to replace ttyACM0 with the name of the serial device on your Raspberry Pi, which may be different. The second argument DEADBEEF is the device address that the node will use. For now these are randomly assigned by users but will be assigned by the network in the future. The third argument, AABBCCDD is the data to send as exadecimal bytes. You should see the following:</p>
<pre>LoRa Tranceiver Configured.
Sending message:  AABBCCDD
Message sent successfully!</pre>
<p>Note that although the message was successfully sent, LoRaWAN messages are unconfirmed by default, meaning that we get no confirmation from the gateway that the message was received.</p>
<h2 id="gateway">Gateway</h2>
<p>In order to connect nodes to TheThingsNetwork and Scriptr, the nodes must be in range of at least one LoRaWAN gateway. The gateway receives the LoRa signal from the node and forwards the packet up to a ThingsNetwork router, after which the data is made available to applications such as one you will build in Scriptr. There are multiple gateways commercially available. We will use the MultiTech Conduit mLinux gateway with a LoRa mCard module.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="conduit.jpg" alt="photo of conduit" /><p class="caption">photo of conduit</p>
</div>
<p>First you will need to assemble the gateway:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Install the LoRa mCard into the Conduit's AP1 slot.</li>
<li>Attach the 915MHz antenna to the LoRa mCard's RF port.</li>
<li>Attach the cellular antenna to the Conduit's CELL port.</li>
<li>Power the Conduit by plugging in the provided AC-DC converter.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="logging-into-the-gateway">Logging into the Gateway</h3>
<p>Next, connect the Conduit to your PC using the provided USB micro-B cable. If you are running OSX or Linux, use the dmesg procedure given in the previous section for determining the serial port for communicating with the Conduit. Then open a serial console with the following console command on OSX or Linux PC:</p>
<pre>screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200</pre>
<p>Where you must replace /dev/ttyACM0 with the serial port appropriate to your machine. The program screen is a simple serial terminal installed on most UNIX-like operating systems. You could use another serial terminal if you prefer, such as Hyperterminal on Windows systems. Upon connecting, you should be greeted with the following banner and login prompt:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="mlinux_login.png" alt="mlinux login" /><p class="caption">mlinux login</p>
</div>
<p>Enter the default username root and password root. You should be dropped to a root bash shell:</p>
<pre>root@mtcdt:~# </pre>
<h3 id="check-firmware-version">Check Firmware Version</h3>
<p>Next you should check that you are running an up-to-date version of the Conduit's mLinux operating system. The latest version is listed on <a href="http://www.multitech.net/developer/downloads/">MultiTech's website</a> and is 3.1.0 at the time of writing. The firmware version is found in the login banner or by running the following command at the Conduit's bash prompt:</p>
<pre>cat /etc/mlinux-version</pre>
<p>If you have a version prior to 3.1.0, contact MultiTech for update instructions.</p>
<h3 id="set-the-time">Set the Time</h3>
<p>Configure the time on the Conduit by running the following commands:</p>
<pre>ln -fs /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime 
date &quot;2010-04-02 14:58:01&quot;
hwclock -u -wm</pre>
<p>Where you should replate America/New_York by your local timezone, and the time in the date command with the current date and time.</p>
<h3 id="connect-to-the-internet">Connect to the Internet</h3>
<p>The Conduit supports connecting to the internet via ethernet or cellular. Here we will cover an Ethernet connection.</p>
<p>Plug the Conduit into an Ethernet network using an ethernet cable. If your network supports DHCP, then the Conduit should already be online. If static IP addressing is required, then edit the /etc/network/interfaces file:</p>
<pre>vi /etc/network/interfaces</pre>
<p>Where you can replace vi with nano if you prefer.</p>
<p>Edit the Wired interface lines with your IP address, subnet, and gateway information. For static IP configuration, an additional post-up line is required to make DNS work. For example:</p>
<pre># Wired interface
auto eth0
#iface eth0 inet dhcp
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.1.201
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1
post-up echo “nameserver 8.8.8.8″ &gt; /etc/resolv.conf</pre>
<p>If you edited the interfaces file for static IP, then run the following command to cause Linux to reload the configuration:</p>
<pre>/etc/init.d/networking restart</pre>
<p>Now test the internet connection:</p>
<pre>ping 8.8.8.8</pre>
<p>And with DNS:</p>
<pre>ping google.com</pre>
<h3 id="install-packet-forwarder">Install Packet Forwarder</h3>
<p>Next we will need to install a program called a &quot;packet forwarder&quot;, which forwards all packets received over the air and pushes them up to a network server on the internet. Run the following command to download Kersing's poly-packet-forwarder:</p>
<pre>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/kersing/packet_forwarder/blob/master/multitech-bin/poly-packet-forwarder_2.1-r2_arm926ejste.ipk?raw=true</pre>
<p>Then install the package by running:</p>
<pre>opkg install poly-packet-forwarder_2.1-r2_arm926ejste.ipk</pre>
<h3 id="edit-config-files">Edit Config Files</h3>
<p>Next we will download pre-edited config files to control where packets are forwarded and which frequencies the Conduit is listening on.</p>
<p>At the Conduit's bash prompt, run the following commands:</p>
<pre>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/chrismerck/conduit_config/blob/master/etc/init.d/lora-network-server?raw=true -O /etc/init.d/lora-network-server
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/chrismerck/conduit_config/blob/master/var/config/lora/global_conf.json?raw=true -O /var/config/lora/global_conf.json
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/chrismerck/conduit_config/blob/master/var/config/lora/local_conf.json?raw=true -O /var/config/lora/local_conf.json</pre>
<p>And now edit your local configuration using vi or your preferred editor:</p>
<pre>vi /var/config/lora/local_conf.json</pre>
<p>Be sure to set your gateway_ID to a unique 64-bit number and set the contact_email and description fields. You should also put the latitude, longitude, and altitude (in meters) of the gateway in the ref_latitude, ref_longitude, and ref_altitude fields, so that other TTN users can see where your gateway is located.</p>
<h3 id="start-the-packet-forwarder">Start the Packet Forwarder</h3>
<p>Now try (re)starting the packet forwarder with the following command:</p>
<pre>/etc/init.d/lora-network-server restart</pre>
<p>To see the log output, run the following:</p>
<pre>tail -f /var/log/lora-pkt-fwd-1.log</pre>
<p>This will display data as it is written to the log file. Press CTRL-C to quit when finished observing the log. Wait about 30 seconds for the packet forwarder to start, and look for the following lines in the log:</p>
<pre>### [UPSTREAM] ###
# RF packets received by concentrator: 0
# CRC_OK: 0.00%, CRC_FAIL: 0.00%, NO_CRC: 0.00%
# RF packets forwarded: 0 (0 bytes)</pre>
<p>This indicates that no packets were received yet by the gateway. Now, go to your Raspberry Pi console and send a packet again:</p>
<pre>python lora_mote_send.py /dev/ttyACM0 DEADBEEF AABBCCDD</pre>
<p>In a moment, you should see in the Conduit log that a packet was demodulated and forwarded:</p>
<pre># RF packets received by concentrator: 1
# CRC_OK: 100.00%, CRC_FAIL: 0.00%, NO_CRC: 0.00%
# RF packets forwarded: 1 (17 bytes)</pre>
<p>This confirms that you successfully have the Raspberry Pi uploading data to the gateway via LoRa modulation.</p>
<h2 id="thethingsnetwork">TheThingsNetwork</h2>
<p>Next we will test reception of our packets by TheThingsNetwork. This step is optional. You will need a PC with a Linux operating system.</p>
<p>First, install the mosquitto MQTT clients:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients</pre>
<p>Now subscribe to messages from your node:</p>
<pre>mosquitto_sub -h croft.thethings.girovito.nl -t nodes/DEADBEEF/packets</pre>
<p>Next time you send a packet from your node, you should see a JSON packet such as:</p>
<pre>{&quot;gatewayEui&quot;:&quot;008000000000ABFF&quot;,&quot;nodeEui&quot;:&quot;DEADBEEF&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2016-04-21T22:02:57.810580982Z&quot;,
 &quot;frequency&quot;:912.1,&quot;dataRate&quot;:&quot;SF7BW125&quot;,&quot;rssi&quot;:-47,&quot;snr&quot;:9.5,
 &quot;rawData&quot;:&quot;QO++rd4AAAAB5LOD2m4hSKE=&quot;,&quot;data&quot;:&quot;3q2+7w==&quot;}</pre>
<p>The data field is encoded in Base64, and when decoded to hex reads AABBCCDD.</p>
<p>You can also subscribe to status messages from your gateway:</p>
<pre>mosquitto_sub -h croft.thethings.girovito.nl -t gateways/008000000000ABFF/status</pre>
<p>Where you should replace 008000000000ABFF with the gateway EUI you specified in local_config.json on the Conduit.</p>
<h2 id="mqtt-to-rest-bridge">MQTT to REST Bridge</h2>
<p>We now need to get data from TheThingsNetwork MQTT broker into an HTTP POST request to Scriptr. We will make a quick-and-dirty MQTT-REST bridge in node.js which you can run on any cloud VM or even a desktop behind a firewall. This bridge can be elimated when MQTT support comes to Scriptr.</p>
<p>Log in to your cloud VM, which we will assume runs Ubuntu Linux. First we install node.js:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm</pre>
<p>Now we create a directory for our project and enter it:</p>
<pre>mkdir -p ~/src/mqtt2scriptr
cd ~/src/mqtt2scriptr</pre>
<p>Now initialize a node.js project here:</p>
<pre>npm init</pre>
<p>Hit Enter to accept each of the defaults. Now install MQTT package:</p>
<pre>npm i --save mqtt</pre>
<p>Now let's write some code to push packets from our nodes to Scriptr. Create a new js file in your mqtt2scriptr directory, call it mqtt2scriptr.js and add the following:</p>
<pre>/* mqtt init */ 
var mqtt    = require(&#39;mqtt&#39;);
var mqtt_client  = mqtt.connect(&#39;mqtt://croft.thethings.girovito.nl&#39;);</pre>
<p>This establishes a connection to TheThingsNetwork MQTT broker. Next add:</p>
<pre>/* http init */ 
var https = require(&#39;https&#39;);
var options = {
  host: &#39;api.scriptrapps.io&#39;,
  path: &#39;/ttn_test&#39;,
  method: &#39;POST&#39;,
  headers: {
    Authorization: &quot;bearer TTUyMXg1MjNCMXpzY3JpcHRyOjhCNDX0NTVERkYwNjhEMDQXQkNBMDQwNUVGXjg3MTFG&quot;
  },
};</pre>
<p>This sets up the parameters of the HTTPS connection to Scritpr. You will need to change the bearer token with your token specific to your account, which we will do in the next section. Next, add a callback to display data returned by Scriptr. This is helpful for debugging:</p>
<pre>/* display data returned from REST service */
rest_callback = function(response) {
  var str = &#39;&#39;
  response.on(&#39;data&#39;, function (chunk) {
    str += chunk;
  });

  response.on(&#39;end&#39;, function () {
    console.log(str);
  });
}</pre>
<p>Now we tell the MQTT client to subscribe to packets from our node:</p>
<pre>/* subscribe to some topics */
mqtt_client.on(&#39;connect&#39;, function () {
  mqtt_client.subscribe(&#39;nodes/DEADBEEF/packets&#39;);
});</pre>
<p>You can add more nodes by adding additional mqtt_client.subscribe() calls. Finally, we add a hook to push any packets received from MQTT out to Scriptr over HTTPS:</p>
<pre>/* forward MQTT packets to REST */
mqtt_client.on(&#39;message&#39;, function (topic, message) {
  console.log(&quot;MQTT Received Packet from TTN: &quot;,message.toString());
  console.log(&quot;Pushing to REST API... &quot;);
  var req = https.request(options, rest_callback);
  req.write(JSON.stringify({topic: topic, message: message.toString()}))
  req.end();
});</pre>
<p>Now save this file, and test it by running:</p>
<pre>node mqtt2scriptr.js</pre>
<p>Now try sending a packet from your LoRaMOTE. Since you have not set up a Scriptr script yet, you should see an error response from scriptr.io:</p>
<pre>Pushing to REST API... 
{&quot;response&quot;: {
  &quot;metadata&quot;: {
    &quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;1a34d45b-7872-4b70-be0f-2f2100d3a420&quot;,
    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;failure&quot;,
    &quot;errorCode&quot;: &quot;SCRIPT_NOT_FOUND&quot;,
    &quot;errorDetail&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
    &quot;statusCode&quot;: &quot;404&quot;
  }
}}</pre>
<p>Now we have only to setup the Scriptr side.</p>
<h2 id="scriptr">Scriptr</h2>
<p>Finally we will create a script on the Scriptr side which will take TTN packets and decode them. After that you can do whatever you want with the data.</p>
<p>Start by forking <a href="https://github.com/chrismerck/scriptr">an example project on GitHub</a>. After forking, the project is available at your github account. We will now setup Scriptr to sync that repo into your Scriptr workspace. Open your Scriptr account, click on your username, and select settings. Then setup the GitHub tab to look as follows:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="github_sync.png" alt="github_sync" /><p class="caption">github_sync</p>
</div>
<p>Just be sure to replace myself with your username. Now click the Synchronize tab, and click the Cloud icon to sync the github repo to your workspace. You should now have a script called ttn_test.</p>
<p>Finally, you will need to get your access token. Click again on your username in Scriptr workspace, then on Account. Now your access token is displayed. Copy that string, and replace the Authentication: &quot;bearer xxxx&quot; line in mqtt2scriptr.js.</p>
<p>Now restart your node.js mqtt2scriptr.js application, and watch its console as you send some packets from the Raspberry Pi. If you send a packet like this from the Pi:</p>
<pre>python lora_mote_send.py /dev/ttyACM0 DEADBEEF AABBCCDDEEFFAA</pre>
<p>You should see a response from Scriptr with the data decoded into hex in the node.js terminal:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="data_recv.png" alt="data_recv" /><p class="caption">data_recv</p>
</div>
<p>You can now add any processing, analysis, or visualization code to Scriptr in the marked section:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="scriptr.png" alt="scriptr code snipit" /><p class="caption">scriptr code snipit</p>
</div>
<h2 id="whats-next">What's Next?</h2>
<p>Now that you have a ThingsNetwork node linked into Scriptr, you can develop applications that go beyond the reach of WiFi, without paying for expensive cellular or satellite data plans.</p>
<p>Do be aware that this setup uses a common session key, which means that although packets are technically encrypted over the air, the packets can be easily decrypted because the encryption key is published. See <a href="http://thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/">TheThingsNetwork WiKi</a> for documentation on setting up per-node encryption keys.</p>
